There are many functions in there. In the sort_algorithm folder you'll find each sort function.

The generator function create random numbers to feed the sort algorithm.

tri.py get acces to every sort algorithm and the generator so you can lunch the same sample of number with all the sort algorithm. The function has flags for more details. Use -h to get the 'How to use' pannel.

cleaner.py is just use for manual sample of number.
